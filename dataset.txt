This is a dataset of organisms with calculated GC content for each data point. 
Why this is significant is that this is a calculation that requires an intense amount of computing power 
to complete, as such we can easily manipulate this data to answer many unique scientific questions. 

One of them being could be answering a question like,
"Do organisms/types of organisms that originate in significantly warmer 
climates have a higher GC content than those that do?"

We can easily use the results of these questions to use as basis for further investigative research into 
these organisms.
